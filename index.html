            Technology is the
            fuel for the society; it provides means to
            ease human lives, and Government Polytechnic, Palanpur is
            one of the institutes that provide skilled and ethical
            engineers to the society. This institute runs basic to advance
            engineering programs. Electronics and communication
            engineering department is one which stands ahead in terms
            of technology and advancements. The department is well
            equipped with the resources to prepare competent and
            industry ready EC engineers catering the needs of
            industries, innovators, and entrepreneurs with moral
            values. It is my great pleasure to see the first band (Volume
            1) of the “Spectrum”, e-newsletter of Electronics and
            Communication Department being published.</h7><br><br>
            
            <h8> <p5>From the desk of Head of Department</p5><br>
Electronics and communication engineering field has
witnessed the evolution of semiconductor from vacuum
tubes to MOSFETs, from telephones to 5G smart
phones. Continuing the evolutionary tradition of the
branch, it gives me immense pleasure to present its first
yearly newsletter “Spectrum”. Spectrum intends to
provide a platform for faculties, students, and all other
stakeholders to share and receive news of latest updates
of the activities carried out in the department. This
newsletter will also be publishing achievements of staff
members and students. I expect students to take the
‘Spectrum’ to new heights. A lot of hard work has gone into publishing this, and every
stakeholder’s involvement will encourage us further. I extend my full cooperation and
best wishes to the entire team behind Spectrum.<BR><BR></h8>
